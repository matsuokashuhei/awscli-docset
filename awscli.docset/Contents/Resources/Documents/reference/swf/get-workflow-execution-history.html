<p class="last"><strong>Access Control</strong></p>
</div>
<p>You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Resource</span></tt> element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.</li>
<li>Use an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Action</span></tt> element to allow or deny permission to call this action.</li>
<li>You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cause</span></tt> parameter is set to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED</span></tt> .

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get-workflow-execution-history</span></tt> is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.

When using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--output</span> <span class="pre">text</span></tt> and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--query</span></tt> argument on a paginated response, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--query</span></tt> argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">events</span></tt></p>
