<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GetFederationToken</span></tt> operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GetFederationToken</span></tt> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em> .</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</span></tt> . For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em> .</p>
</div>
<p>You can also call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GetFederationToken</span></tt> using the security credentials of an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em> .</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Session duration</strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Permissions</strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GetFederationToken</span></tt> in any AWS service except the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API.</li>
<li>You cannot call any STS operations except <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GetCallerIdentity</span></tt> .</li>
</ul>
<p>You must pass an inline or managed <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p>
<p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em> . For information about using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GetFederationToken</span></tt> to create temporary security credentials, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken">GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a> .</p>
<p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Principal</span></tt> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Tags</strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em> .</p>
<p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em> .</p>
<p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Department</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">department</span></tt> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Department</span></tt> =``Marketing`` tag and you pass the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">department</span></tt> =``engineering`` session tag. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Department</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">department</span></tt> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>
