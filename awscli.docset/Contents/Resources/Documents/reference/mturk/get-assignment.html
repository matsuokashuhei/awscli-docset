<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--cli-input-json</span></tt> (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--generate-cli-skeleton</span></tt>. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--generate-cli-skeleton</span></tt> (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input</span></tt>, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--cli-input-json</span></tt>. If provided with the value <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">output</span></tt>, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ActionsGuarded</span></tt> field on each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">QualificationRequirement</span></tt> structure.</p>
<p>(structure)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.</p>
<p>QualificationTypeId -&gt; (string)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparator -&gt; (string)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user's profile, regardless of its value.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>IntegerValues -&gt; (list)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.</p>
<p>(integer)</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>LocaleValues -&gt; (list)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.</p>
<p>(structure)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.</p>
<p>Country -&gt; (string)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Subdivision -&gt; (string)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>RequiredToPreview -&gt; (boolean)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>DEPRECATED: Use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ActionsGuarded</span></tt> field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ActionsGuarded</span></tt> field.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>ActionsGuarded -&gt; (string)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RequiredToPreview</span></tt> field.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>HITReviewStatus -&gt; (string)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>NumberOfAssignmentsPending -&gt; (integer)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable -&gt; (integer)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted -&gt; (integer)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.</div>
</blockquote>
